You probably already aware that avocado is one of the most nutritious fruits around. These creamy fruits are great for weight loss, healthy-skin and hair, balanced blood sugar levels, increased nutrient absorption and digestive health.
However, most avocado lovers are unaware that they are throwing away the most nutritious part of the fruit, the seed. Yes, you can eat that big, brown, rocklike seed. They represent up to 20% of the whole avocado. 
How to eat avocado seed?
After removing it from the avocado, rinse, and dehydrate it at 250 degrees of Fahrenheit for 2 hours. Take it out, remove the outer skin and place it on the counter. Press on the seed with the back of a big thick knife blade, the pit will split in two. Dice the pit halves and put it in a high-power blender and pause until it has turned into a powder. Add them to your smoothies, Oatmeal and baking. Some benefits of this often-overlooked component of the avocado fruit include:
1.    A rich source of antioxidants
The seed shows much higher antioxidants and fennel contents than the fruit edible portions. In fact, the seed contains around 70% of the fruit’s total antioxidant contents. 
A 2013 report published in the Journal Current Pharmaceutical Design indicates the fennel compounds and antioxidants in the fruit maybe the reason avocado has so many health benefits.
2.    High in dietary fibre
The avocado seed is among the best sources of soluble fibres in the diet, according to many health experts. Along with maintaining health cholesterol levels, soluble fibres balances blood sugar levels, meaning avocado seed can help avoid the peaks and dips of energy.
