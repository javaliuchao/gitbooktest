If Tomorrow Starts Without Me 

（Michael）When tomorrow starts without me,
And I'm not there to see,
If the sun should rise and find your eyes
all filled with tears for me,

I wish so much you wouldn't cry
The way you did today,
While thinking of the many things,
We didn't get to say.

（Light Rain）I know how much you love me,
As much as I love you,
and each time that you think of me,
I know you'll miss me too.

But when tomorrow starts without me,
Please try to understand,
That an angel came and called my name,
And took me by the hand,
and said my place was ready,
In heaven far above,
And that I'd have to leave behind
All those I dearly love.

（Kathy）But as I turned to walk away,
A tear fell from my eye
For all my life, I'd always thought,
I didn't want to die.

I had so much to live for,
So much left yet to do,
It seemed almost impossible,
That I was leaving you.

I thought of all the yesterdays
The good ones and the bad,
I thought of all the love we shared,
and all the fun we had

（Tony）If I could re-live yesterday
Just even for a while,
I'd say good-bye and kiss you
And maybe see you smile.

But then I fully realized,
That this could never be,
For emptiness and memories,
would take the place of me.

And when I thought of worldly things,
I might miss come tomorrow,
I thought of you, and when I did,
My heart was filled with sorrow.
（Lobyster）But when I walked through heaven's gates,
I felt so much at home
When God looked down and smiled at me,
From His great golden throne.

He said, "This is eternity,
And all I've promised you."
Today your life on earth is past,
But here life starts anew
I promise no tomorrow,
But today will always last,
And since each day's the same way
There's no longing for the past.

（VC）You have been so faithful,
So trusting and so true.
Though there were times
You did some things
You knew you shouldn't do.

（VC）But you have been forgiven
And now at last you're free.
So won't you come and take my hand
And share my life with me?

（Light Rain）So when tomorrow starts without me,
Don't think we're far apart,
For every time you think of me,
I'm right here, in your heart.

GALINDA
Elphie - now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project.

ELPHABA
You really don't have to do that

GALINDA
I know. That's what makes me so nice!
Whenever I see someone
Less fortunate than I
(And let's face it - who isn't
Less fortunate than I?)
My tender heart
Tends to start to bleed
And when someone needs a makeover
I simply have to take over
I know I know exactly what they need
And even in your case
Tho' it's the toughest case I've yet to face
Don't worry - I'm determined to succeed
Follow my lead
And yes, indeed
You will be:

Popular!
You're gonna be popular!
I'll teach you the proper ploys
When you talk to boys
Little ways to flirt and flounce
I'll show you what shoes to wear
How to fix your hair
Everything that really counts
To be popular
I'll help you be popular!
You'll hang with the right cohorts
You'll be good at sports
Know the slang you've got to know
So let's start
'Cause you've got an awfully long way to go:

Don't be offended by my frank analysis
Think of it as personality dialysis
Now that I've chosen to be come a pal, a
Sister and adviser
There's nobody wiser
Not when it comes to popular -
I know about popular
And with an assist from me
To be who you'll be
Instead of dreary who-you-were... well, are
There's nothing that can stop you
From becoming popu-ler ... lar!

La la la la
We're gonna make you popular

When I see depressing creatures
With unprepossessing features
I remind them on their own behalf
To think of
Celebrated heads of state or
Specially great communicators
Did they have brains or knowledge?
Don't make me laugh!

They were popular! Please -
It's all about popular!
It's not about aptitude
It's the way you're viewed
So it's very shrewd to be
Very very popular
Like me!

Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you. You're beautiful.

ELPHABA
I - I have to go:

GALINDA
You're welcome!
And though you protest
Your disinterest
I know clandestinely
You're gonna grin and bear it
Your new found popularity
La la la la
You'll be popular -
Just not as quite as popular
As me!

文猪儿子April Is a Dog's Dream
BY MARILYN SINGER
april is a dog's dream
the soft grass is growing
the sweet breeze is blowing
the air all full of singing feels just right
so no excuses now
we're going to the park
to chase and charge and chew
and I will make you see
what spring is all about

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

"The Star-Spangled Banner,
the national anthem of the United States."

O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed ——at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars ——through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night ——that our flag was still there;
O say does that star-spangled ——banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free ——and the home of the brave?(已编辑)
《星条旗永不落》歌词中文大意是：
啊！在晨曦初现时，你可看见
是什么让我们如此骄傲？
在黎明的最后一道曙光中欢呼，
是谁的旗帜在激战中始终高扬！
烈火熊熊，炮声隆隆，
我们看到要塞上那面英勇的旗帜
在黑暗过后依然耸立！
啊！你说那星条旗是否会静止，
在自由的土地上飘舞，
在勇者的家园上飞扬？
